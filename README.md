Hello guys,
This is my first Tidy Tuesday contribution on the coffee ratings. 
I did various plots of the same, a bit tidying here and there and i had fun doing it. 
I hope you do enjoy following the codes and learning. Coffee is a beverage enjoyed across the globe.
African produced coffee beans are richly infused with caffeine and as you'll see in the plotting of this 
dataset, Ethiopia and Kenya's coffee and a great delcacy. 
Coffee from Guatemala was also topping the sweetness charts analysis.
Noow, let me go get my cup!
