# Hello-world
Newbie's story

Just a beginner here getting started on github and learning all things tech and code. I aprreciate the role that technology is playing in our day to day activities such as in statistics and in other fields of science, art etc.
How did i get into tech?
Okay so before i go any further, I'm Kenyan aged 21 years and yes as my name  suggest codess, im female, not sure how feminine or feministic i can get but we'll see inshallah!
I'm ethnically ambiguous or very richly ethnic. My English doesn't sound like  most people because i don't think i have a heavy accent if i did well maybe it got masked in the books ive read and/or drowned in those jams by Drake and Breezy. Kidding,but true!

So, i pursue actuarial science...Thats how i got into tech officially.  But ever since i was a child i recall my dad taking me to the office with him and he would leave me with the secretarywho had a computer and i'd play games and try those typing  fast games i forgot the name. I played chess at a very young gae and solitare too. Haha , I rocked! Basiccally im jjust writing my life story her on GitHub i guess so maybe i should change the title or repository  i guess...still learning. I fixed stuff anything elecronic as a child and it was crazy how i  could just understand i needed to do this and it worked. Connecting Wifi at home, tethering, i never browsed not even how to project but as a child, I did all this by the time i was 8 yrs. So thats my love for electronics and math.


Installing R and Rstudio was something i did because i had to have them for class and tutorials. Little did i know id fall madly in love, head over heels for it. So code after code, i ran. They worked! i got exicited ad tried more. In my tech adventures, i met incredible people who im still learning from and this led meto GitHub. 

I look forward to learn more and grow! More later.
